# Gustavo Brito

Hey there! My name is Gustavo (you can call me Gus!) and I'm a full-stack developer. Currently, I work as a software engineer at [Mercado Pago](https://mercadopago.com.br/), mainly developing payment provider applications that integrate the Mercado Pago ecosystem with different platforms, such as Shopify and Woocommerce.

Nowadays, I mostly do backend work using Java, Javascript and sometimes Go, but I also have some experience working on frontend development, especially with React.
